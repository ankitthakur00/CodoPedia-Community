## Technical

Why Java is Partially OOP language?

1. It supports usual declaration of primitive data types
2.  It doesnâ€™t support all types of inheritance
3.  It allows code to be written outside classes 
4.  It does not support pointers

{% hint style="success" %}
**Answer:** It supports usual declaration of primitive data types

Explanation: As Java supports usual declaration of data variables, it is partial implementation of OOP. Because according to rules of OOP, object constructors must be used, even for declaration of variables.

## Coding Question

You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if: arr.length &gt;= 3 .There exists some index i \(0-indexed\) with 0 &lt; i &lt; arr.length - 1 such that:

arr\[0\] &lt; arr\[1\] &lt; ... &lt; arr\[i - 1\] &lt; arr\[i\]

arr\[i\] &gt; arr\[i + 1\] &gt; ... &gt; arr\[arr.length - 1\]

Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.

```text
Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5] 
Output: 5 
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5. 

Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,2,2] 
Output: 0
 Explanation: There is no mountain.
```

_Intuition: We have already many 2-pass or 3-pass problems, like 821. Shortest Distance to a Character. They have almost the same idea. One forward pass and one backward pass. Maybe another pass to get the final result, or you can merge it in one previous pass._

Explanation: In this problem, we take one forward pass to count up hill length \(to every point\). We take another backward pass to count down hill length \(from every point\). Finally a pass to find max\(up\[i\] + down\[i\] + 1\) where up\[i\] and down\[i\] should be positives.

Time Complexity: O\(N\)

## Solution:

```cpp
int longestMountain(vector<int> A) {
        int N = A.size(), res = 0;
        vector<int> up(N, 0), down(N, 0);
        for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; --i) if (A[i] > A[i + 1]) down[i] = down[i + 1] + 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (i > 0 && A[i] > A[i - 1]) up[i] = up[i - 1] + 1;
            if (up[i] && down[i]) res = max(res, up[i] + down[i] + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
