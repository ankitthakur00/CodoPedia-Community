# Day 26 : Tasks

## Aptitude 

Out of 40 consecutive numbers two are chosen at random the probability that their sum is odd is ?

* 20/39
* 2/7
* 25/36
* 26/36

{% hint style="success" %}
**Ans:20/39**

 ****To get the sum of 2 integers as odd one must be even and the other one must be odd.In 40 consecutive integers, 20 are even and 20 are odd.
{% endhint %}

## **Technical MCQ**

The disjoint set data structure plays a key role in which Algorithm to determine the minimum spanning tree of the graph? 

* Floyd Warshall's algorithm
* Kruskal's algorithm
* Dijkstra's algorithm
* None of these

{% hint style="success" %}
**Ans:** Kruskal's Algorithm
{% endhint %}

## Coding Question

You are given two arrays \(without duplicates\) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are a subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example 1:**

 **`Input:`** 

```text
nums1 = [4,1,2]
nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
```

**`Output:`** 

```text
[-1,3,-1]
```

**`Explanation:`** For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1. For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3. For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
